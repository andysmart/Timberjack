Timberjack is a simple, unintrusive network activity logger. Log every request your app makes, or limit to only those using a certain `NSURLSession` if you'd prefer. It also works with [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire), if that's your thing.

*Note, Timberjack is written in Swift 2.0, so you'll need Xcode7 to build. If you're using Swift 1.2, there's a compatible version on the swift-1.2 branch*

- Enable logging across your app with just 1 line of code
- Verbose and Light debugging modes
- Works with `NSURLSession`, `NSURLConnection`, `Alamofire` and pretty much any networking framework
- Pretty printed `JSON` responses
- Useful for debugging and development, but probably best not to ship your app with verbose logging.

##Installation

Timberjack is installed as an embedded framework, and such requires at least iOS8. If you require iOS7 compatibility, simply drag the `Timberjack.swift` file into your own project.

###Cocoapods

Add the following to your Podfile

````ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'Timberjack'

````

Then install with `pod install`

###Carthage

Add the following to your Cartfile

````ruby
github "andysmart/Timberjack" >= 0.0.1
````

##Usage

Nice and easy, just register when your app loads, and Timberjack will monitor and log any requests you make via `NSURLSession` or `NSURLConnection`.

````swift
import UIKit
import Timberjack

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    var window: UIWindow?

    func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
        Timberjack.register() //Register Timberjack to log all requests

        return true
    }
}
````

###Using with Alamofire

Due to the way Alamofire uses NSURLSession, you'll need to do a little more than the standard installation to monitor all requests. The simplest way to do this is to create a subclass of `Manager` to handle your requests, then just use this in place of `Alamofire.request()`.

````swift
import Alamofire
import Timberjack

class HTTPManager: Alamofire.Manager {
    static let sharedManager: HTTPManager = {
        let configuration = Timberjack.defaultSessionConfiguration()
        let manager = HTTPManager(configuration: configuration)
        return manager
    }()
}
````

###Configuration

Timberjack has two modes: Verbose and Light. The default style is `Verbose`. To change this, just set it appropriately.

````swift
Timberjack.logStyle = .Verbose //Either .Verbose, or .Light
````

It is also possible to filtered which URL you want to log.
2 modes exist: *Black list mode* and *White list mode*. The default mode is *Black list*

````swift
Timberjack.filteredMode = .Black
let urlFiltered = NSURL(string: "http://www.example.com")
Timberjack.blackListUrl = [urlFiltered!] // All requests going and coming from example.com will be ignored
````

##Bugs or Issues

Open an issue here, or ping me a message on Twitter. Even better, fork this repo and open a pull-request!

*Unfortunately, due to a limitation in `NSURLProtocol`, Timberjack is unable to log the HTTP body of a request, see [This radar](http://openradar.appspot.com/15993891) for more details*
